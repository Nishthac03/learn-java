// JAVA uses both compiler (javac) and interpretor (JVM).

//java source code is saved with .java extension.
// '.java ' file is converted to ' .class ' file by javac.

/* .class --> It is also called byte code. 
This file can run on any Operating system without any recompilation or any changes, unlike .exe file in C++ which can't be executed on different Operating Systems.
This byte code makes JAVA a more secure language. */

// .java file is executed by JVM and .exe file is generated.
