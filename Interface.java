*** Interface ***

Multiple inheritance can be implemented using Interfaces

 * we can have abstract method inside interface
 * 
 * if u want to give body to a method u have to make it default or static
 * eg.  
  default void playGame(){
   statement 1...;
  }
 
 * They cannot be instatiated , can be only implemented by class or extended by other interfaces.
 * Interfaces cannot have an object
  
 * By default variable are static and public
 * By default methods are sttic and public
