/*Alice is asked to implement a Java program in which 3 integers X, Y are taken as input and all the numbers between X and Y (excluding X and Y) 
must be added and the sum is displayed as output. 

If there is no number in between, in cases like Y is greater than X or both are equal, etc., NO OUTPUT should be displayed.*/
