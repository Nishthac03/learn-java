Two types - Primitive , Non-primitive

Non-primitive data types: include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

primitives used to hold  *integer* values --> (byte, short, int, long):

byte is an 8-bit signed integer.
short is a 16-bit signed integer.
int is a 32-bit signed integer.
long is a 64-bit signed integer.

size:   byte < short < int < long


Java uses 'Unicode system' not ASCII code system.
 * This is the reason why char uses 2 byte in java.
